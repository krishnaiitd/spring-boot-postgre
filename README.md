### Spring Boot is a popular Java-based framework that is designed to simplify the development of web applications. Spring Boot applications typically follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

#### Here is a high-level overview of the typical architecture of a Spring Boot application:
1. VIEW -> Presentation Layer -> This layer is responsible for handling user input and rendering the appropriate response. In a Spring Boot application, the presentation layer is usually implemented using a templating engine like Thymeleaf or a front-end framework like Angular or React.
2. MODEL 
   1. Data Access Layer -> This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or other data storage mechanisms. Spring Boot provides support for various data access technologies, including JDBC, JPA, and Hibernate
   2. Service Layer -> This layer contains the business logic of the application. It interacts with the data access layer to retrieve and manipulate data. In Spring Boot, the service layer is typically implemented using the @Service annotation.
3. Controller -> Response for communicating between VIEW & Service Layer

### Other components:
1. Configuration Layer -> This layer contains the configuration files for the application. It includes settings related to the database connection, security, and other application-specific configurations. Spring Boot uses the application.properties or application.yml file to store configuration settings.
2. Utilities Layer -> This layer includes any utility classes or methods that are used across the application.

### This diagram shows the high-level flow of a Spring Boot application.
1. A user sends a request to the web container, such as Tomcat, which then passes the request to the Dispatcher Servlet.
2. The Dispatcher Servlet finds the appropriate Handler method, which is typically a Controller class, based on the URL mapping.
3. The Handler method retrieves data from the Data source via a Repository or DAO class.
4. The Handler method processes the data and sends it to the Service layer, which contains the application's business logic.
5. The Service layer processes the data further and sends it to the Model layer, which contains the entities or data objects that the application uses to represent data.
6. The Model layer sends the data to the View layer, which renders the response using templates. 
7. The Dispatcher Servlet sends the response back to the user. 
8. If an exception occurs at any point during this process, it is handled by the Exceptions handling component.
Overall, this flow diagram demonstrates how Spring Boot follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to handle user requests and responses, and how it separates concerns to keep the application maintainable and scalable.
