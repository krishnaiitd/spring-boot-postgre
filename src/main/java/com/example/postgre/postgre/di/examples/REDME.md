Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to implement Inversion of Control (IoC). In a Spring Boot application, DI is used to manage the dependencies between various components or beans.

The Spring framework provides an IoC container that manages the creation and injection of beans. A bean is a Java object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring container.

To use DI in a Spring Boot application, you typically do the following:

Define your beans: Create the Java classes that you want to use as beans in your application. Annotate these classes with the @Component or other stereotype annotations to tell Spring that they are beans.

Declare dependencies: Declare the dependencies that each bean has on other beans. You can do this using the @Autowired annotation or constructor injection.

Configure the container: Configure the Spring container to create and manage the beans. This can be done using XML or Java configuration, or with annotations like @Configuration and @Bean.

When the application starts up, the Spring container creates all the beans and injects the necessary dependencies. This way, the dependencies between the beans are managed automatically, and you can focus on writing the business logic of your application.

Here's a simple example of how DI works in Spring Boot:

    @Component
    public class MyService {
    
        private final MyRepository repository;
    
        @Autowired
        public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
            this.repository = repository;
        }
    
        // business methods...
    }
    
    @Component
    public class MyRepository {
    
        // database access methods...
    }
    
    @Configuration
    public class AppConfig {
    
        @Bean
        public MyService myService(MyRepository repository) {
            return new MyService(repository);
        }
    
        @Bean
        public MyRepository myRepository() {
            return new MyRepository();
        }
    }


In this example, we have two beans: MyService and MyRepository. MyService depends on MyRepository, so we inject it using constructor injection. We also define a @Configuration class called AppConfig, which defines the beans and their dependencies. Finally, we annotate both MyService and MyRepository with @Component to indicate that they are beans that should be managed by the Spring container.

When the application starts up, the Spring container creates MyRepository and passes it to MyService. This way, MyService can use the methods of MyRepository to access the database.

I hope this helps you understand how Dependency Injection works in Spring Boot!
